====== Schema Assignments ======

Here you can define patterns to automatically assign schemas to pages. Whenever a page matches one of the patterns here, the appropiate schemas will be shown.

  * Namespaces excluding subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:*</nowiki>''.
  * Namespaces including subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:**</nowiki>''.
  * Pages as usual with their full page ID.
  * Regular Expressions starting and ending with ''/'' - they are matched against a '':'' prefixed full page id.
